/**
 * Fastify-based sidecar for the sprite gallery lab.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - GET  /api/health                                                       — readiness probe
 *   - GET  /api/runs                                                         — list all runs
 *   - GET  /api/runs/:briefId/:runId                                         — full RunSummary JSON
 *   - GET  /api/runs/:briefId/:runId/sheets                                  — list source sheet PNGs
 *   - GET  /api/runs/:briefId/:runId/sheet/:filename                         — source sheet PNG bytes
 *   - GET  /api/runs/:briefId/:runId/processed/:filename                     — static-file from run dir
 *   - GET  /api/runs/:briefId/:runId/raw/:filename                           — raw (pre-pipeline) cell PNG
 *   - POST /api/runs/:briefId/:runId/approve                                 — approve a variant (mutating)
 *
 * Security contract (spec §F8):
 *   - The HTTP server MUST bind to 127.0.0.1 only. Binding is the CLI's job
 *     (`./cli.ts`); this module exposes only `buildServer(deps)` so tests
 *     can run requests through `inject()` without ever opening a socket.
 *   - The static-file route MUST validate that the resolved path stays
 *     inside the configured runsDir. A request like `../../etc/passwd`
 *     would otherwise expose the whole filesystem.
 *   - The approve route MUST refuse when `process.env.CI` is set
 *     (Constitutional §3 — no LLM-as-judge / no checked-in mutation from
 *     CI gates). Same pattern as `judge.ts`.
 *
 * No business logic lives here. The sidecar is a thin HTTP shell over file
 * IO — every meaningful piece is implemented (and unit-tested) in the
 * `scripts/sprites/` modules that the orchestrator already uses.
